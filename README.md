# Tata Sky m3u generator web app
A react web app to generate an m3u playlist for the channels subscribed on Tata Sky.
## Update
Converted to a single repo to make it a one click deploy on vercel/render as a lot of you non-technical people were facing difficulties while deploying.
## Deploy

## Run locally (You need a little bit of git and npm knowledge)
1) Clone this repo.
2) Open cmd / terminal and type the below commands one by one.<br>
a) npm install<br>
b) npm run dev
3) Enjoy!

Once you generate the m3u URL, you don't need to do it every 24 hours. It will automatically generate fresh JWT on every request.
